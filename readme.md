# Lojix
A meta-programming framework, forked from Clojure, running on its own
hardware/OS-agnostic runtime, and the basis for LojixOS, an upcoming
fork/improvement of [NixOS][3].

## Motivation
The evident need for an "Ideal" framework, from the point of view of
the "consumer" - programmers and/or high-abstraction-users - or more
concisly, the logical-UI users.

## Attributions
### Version
#### Beta Concept
#### Second Phase
The concept is to combine the greatest programming UI in current
existence, namely Clojure (to be upgraded to Sajban/Mentci), with the
most advanced software/OS-building project, namely Nix(OS), to produce
a replicatable and easily auditable full-stack programming framework,
which is currently given the name *Lojix*.

#### First Phase
The concept of "lisping" nix owes inspiration from [Guix][4]. The
homoiconic design of [Clojure][5] qualifies it as the most advanced
and beautifully designed programming interface today. The combination
of those technologies would deeply revolutionize software
production. Much Gratitude goes to all the great minds behind those
projects.

#### Alpha Concept
Most of the original draft is a direct adaptation of
[haskell-flake][1].  Much gratitude also goes to the authors of
[flake-parts][2], which lojix depends on.
