# Clojix
Nix from Clojure, and the basis for ClojixOS, an upcoming fork of
[NixOS][3].

## Attributions
### Version
#### Beta
The concept owes inspiration from [Guix][4], of course. And the
amazing coding interface of [Clojure][5] is another testament to the
wisdom in desiging [Clojure][5] thus far, making it the most advanced
and beautifully designed lisp dialect today, and therefore it must be
similarly named with respect to *all known* coding interfaces
today. Much Gratitude goes to all the great minds behind those
projects.

#### Alpha
Most of the original draft is a direct adaptation of
[haskell-flake][1].  Much gratitude also goes to the authors of
[flake-parts][2], which clojix depends on.
