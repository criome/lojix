# Clojix
Nix from Clojure, and the basis for ClojixOS, an upcoming fork of
[NixOS][3].

## Attributions
### Version
#### Beta
The concept of "lisping" nix owes inspiration from [Guix][4]. The
homoiconic design of [Clojure][5] qualifies it as the most advanced
and beautifully designed programming interface today. The combination
of those technologies would deeply revolutionize software
production. Much Gratitude goes to all the great minds behind those
projects.

#### Alpha
Most of the original draft is a direct adaptation of
[haskell-flake][1].  Much gratitude also goes to the authors of
[flake-parts][2], which clojix depends on.
